## Hi there 👋, I am Alex Zongo.

👀 My interests lie at the intersection of Aerospace Engineering, Reinforcement Learning, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Flight Control Systems Design (mechanical and fly-by-wire), and Intelligent Systems in general.

👨🏾‍🏫 I aspire to share the little knowledge I have through teaching, workshops, and seminars. 

🔭 I’m currently working on Advanced Air Mobility via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Vision, and Large Language Models. 

👯 I’m open to collaboration on any projects aligning with my expertise.

📫 You are welcome to check my [website](https://alex-zongo.github.io/) and contact me at: [alexanicetzongo@gmail.com](alexanicetzongo@gmail.com) or [a.zongo@gwu.edu](a.zongo@gwu.edu).

⚡ Fun fact: I love music, and I am an active learner and gospel piano player 🎹
